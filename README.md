**PyCity Schools Data Conclusions:**

All the top-performing schools were charter type and all the low-performing schools belonged to district type. Although there was not much difference in the average math or average reading scores from both the school types, the percentage of students passing in math or reading or in both was considerably higher in charter school types as compared to the district school types


All the district schools had larger student populations and higher per capita budgets than charter schools. Small and medium-sized (based on student count) schools outperformed compared to the schools with larger student counts.

The percentage of students passing in Reading was significantly higher (and more or less consistent) in all the schools. However, there was a significant variation in the percentage of students passing in Math across different schools. Small and medium-sized dramatically outperformed in Maths as compared to the large-sized schools
